Since September 2021, I am a post-doctoral researcher at [INRIA SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), working with [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/).

**I defended my PhD in July 2021. The manuscript can be found [here](files/AUBIN_PhD_manuscript_EDVersion.pdf), the slides are [here](files/AUBIN_PhD_slides_040721.pdf).**

I obtained my PhD in July 2021 from [PSL](https://psl.eu/) [MINES ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) (Paris), at the [CAS laboratory](http://cas.ensmp.fr/), where I was advised by [Nicolas Petit](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~petit/), working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods. This revolves around optimization problems in infinite dimensions with infinitely many constraints. I am interested in the near future in studying connections between kernels and dynamical constrained/controlled/estimated systems, among which measures, continuity equations (see [ICML21](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/korba21a.html)) and structured learning problems.

During my PhD, I defined a new positive definite kernel, dubbed the Linear-Quadratic kernel. It is a matrix-valued reproducing kernel, instrumental in Linear-Quadratic optimal control, related to the Gramian of controllability and to the dual Riccati equation (see [pdf](publication/PCAF_CRAS2020/PCAF_CRAS2020text/PCAF_CRAS2020text.pdf) for an introduction, [pdf](publication/PCAF_SICON2020/PCAF_SICON2020arxiv/PCAF_SICON2020arxiv.pdf) for the application to state constraints, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09419) with [Alain Bensoussan](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/alain.bensoussan) for a general formula extended to PDE control).

I have also developped a general, convex and modular framework to handle shape constraints in RKHSs (see [pdf](publication/PCAF_JMLR2021/PCAF_JMLR2021arxiv/PCAF_JMLR2021arxiv.pdf)), applied for instance to trajectory reconstruction (see [NeuriPS 2020 video](https://slideslive.com/embed/presentation/38936233?url=https%3A%2F%2Fneurips.cc%2Fvirtual%2F2020%2Fprotected%2Fposter_03fa2f7502f5f6b9169e67d17cbf51bb.html&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fneurips.cc&target_id=presentation-embed&auto_play=&zoom_ratio=&disable_fullscreen=&locale=en&demo=&vertical_enabled=true&vertical_enabled_on_mobile=&vertical_when_width_lte=500&allow_hidden_controls_when_paused=true&debug_slideslive_player=&user_uuid=04174542-23c2-4cba-9cae-238237fa3c3b) for a quick overview in 180s). This is a line of work, originally inspired by non-crossing quantile regression, with [Zoltán Szabó](https://zoltansz.github.io/). We were particularly motivated by econometrics and finance studies. 

I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).

My research and my [lyricomania](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/lyricomanie), a passion I share within the association [Juvenilia](https://juvenilia.eu/), do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly [paint](https://www.arplastix.com/pierre-cyril-aubin/).
