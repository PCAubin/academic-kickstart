Since September 2018, I am a Ph.D. student at the [CAS laboratory](http://cas.ensmp.fr/) at Mines ParisTech, advised by [Nicolas Petit](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~petit/), working on learning the dynamics of control systems through kernel methods. I am especially working on a new positive definite kernel, which I named the Linear-Quadratic kernel, a matrix-valued reproducing kernel instrumental in Linear-Quadratic optimal control.


Lately, I have focused on dealing with the constraints appearing in optimal control or trajectory reconstruction. This is part of a work on general shape constraints in kernel regression with [Zoltán Szabó](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~zoltan.szabo/index.html), for e.g. non-crossing quantile regression.

I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).

My PhD and my [lyricomania](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/lyricomanie) do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly [paint](https://www.arplastix.com/pierre-cyril-aubin/).
