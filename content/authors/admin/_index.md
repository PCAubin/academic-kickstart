## **Biography**

Starting Dec 2024, I am an associate professor at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and a researcher at CERMICS, in the Optimization team. In 2023-24 I was a postdoc in the [VADOR team](https://www.tuwien.at/mg/vador/) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien) with [Aris Daniilidis](https://www.arisdaniilidis.at/). In 2021-23, I was a post-doctoral researcher at [INRIA SIERRA](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), working with [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). I obtained my PhD in July 2021 from [PSL](https://psl.eu/) [MINES ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) (Paris), at the [CAS laboratory](http://cas.ensmp.fr/), working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods ([manuscript](files/AUBIN_PhD_manuscript_EDVersion.pdf), [slides](files/AUBIN_PhD_slides_040721.pdf)). I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with [Jean-Philippe Vert](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/) (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).

I am interested in the links between kernel methods, optimal control, Kalman filtering and optimization in measure spaces. So far I have shown that kernels appear in linear-quadratic optimal control because of Hilbertian vector spaces of trajectories, while, for estimation problems, they appear through covariances of Gaussian processes. It is this *dual*, deterministic and stochastic, nature of kernels which underlies the *duality* between optimal control and estimation in the Linear-Quadratic case (see [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07030), [slides](publication/PCAF_Kalman2022slides/PCAF_Kalman2022slides.pdf) with [Alain Bensoussan](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~axb046100/)). Kernels even extend to mean-field control ([article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11435)).

My latest focus is on optimization problems where the notion of distance is replaced by a generic cost function ([article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04917)). The natural algorithm here is alternating minimization for which we gave novel rates with [Flavien Léger](https://flavienleger.github.io/). I also  work on the characterization of order isomorphisms with [Stéphane Gaubert](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert/) ([article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06857) and [slides](publication/PCAF_Isomorphisms2024/PCAF_Isomorphisms_slides_AKOR_110424.pdf)). 

My research and my [lyricomania](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/lyricomanie), a passion I share within the association [Juvenilia](https://juvenilia.eu/), do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly [paint](https://www.arplastix.com/pierre-cyril-aubin/).
