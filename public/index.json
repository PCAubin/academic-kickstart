This revolves around optimization problems in infinite dimensions with infinitely many constraints. I am interested in the near future in studying connections between kernels and dynamical constrained/controlled/estimated systems, among which measures, continuity equations (see ICML21) and structured learning problems.\nDuring my PhD, I defined a new positive definite kernel, dubbed the Linear-Quadratic kernel. It is a matrix-valued reproducing kernel, instrumental in Linear-Quadratic optimal control, related to the Gramian of controllability and to the dual Riccati equation (see pdf for an introduction, pdf for the application to state constraints, arxiv with Alain Bensoussan for a general formula extended to PDE control).\nI have also developped a general, convex and modular framework to handle shape constraints in RKHSs (see pdf), applied for instance to trajectory reconstruction (see NeuriPS 2020 video for a quick overview in 180s). This is a line of work, originally inspired by non-crossing quantile regression, with Zoltán Szabó.

In 2023-24 I was a postdoc in the VADOR team at TU Wien with Aris Daniilidis. In 2021-23, I was a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA SIERRA, working with Alessandro Rudi. I obtained my PhD in July 2021 from PSL MINES ParisTech (Paris), at the CAS laboratory, working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods (manuscript, slides). I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with Jean-Philippe Vert (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).\nI am interested in the links between kernel methods, optimal control, Kalman filtering and optimization in measure spaces. So far I have shown that kernels appear in linear-quadratic optimal control because of Hilbertian vector spaces of trajectories, while, for estimation problems, they appear through covariances of Gaussian processes. It is this dual, deterministic and stochastic, nature of kernels which underlies the duality between optimal control and estimation in the Linear-Quadratic case (see arXiv, slides with Alain Bensoussan). Kernels even extend to mean-field control (article).\nMy latest focus is on optimization problems where the notion of distance is replaced by a generic cost function (article). The natural algorithm here is alternating minimization for which we gave novel rates with Flavien Léger. I also work on the characterization of order isomorphisms with Stéphane Gaubert (article and slides).\nMy research and my lyricomania, a passion I share within the association Juvenilia, do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly paint.\nContact: pierre-cyril[dot]aubin(at)enpc[dot]fr\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pcaubin.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"\rNews Starting Dec 2024, I am a permanent researcher/associate professor at CERMICS, ENPC, near Paris.\nNew article with Yohann de Castro, Axel Parmentier, Alessandro Rudi, on Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, slides\nNew article with Stéphane Gaubert, on the characterization of order isomorphisms, slides\nNew article with Alain Bensoussan, on the RKHSs of push-forward maps for mean-field control,\nNew article with Flavien Léger, on alternating minimization and gradient descent with a general cost, slides\nIf you want an overview of some of my research up to July 2023 concerning optimization and kernels, here are some slides\n","tags":null,"title":"Pierre-Cyril Aubin-Frankowski","type":"authors"}]
